## 0.3.3

- Added text `description` column to the following models:
  - `Account`
  - `ArchivedEntry`
  - `ArchivedTransaction`
  - `Currency`
  - `Customer`
  - `Entry`
  - `Identity`
  - `Ledger`
  - `Statement`
  - `Transaction`
  - `Vendor`
- Corrected `Customer` and `Vendor`: `details` column was incorrectly handled as
  a packify.SerializableType stored as a blob, but the column type was text.
  This has been corrected, and a note has been added to the documentation to
  indicate that this will be changed to a packify.SerializableType stored as a
  blob in 0.4.0.
